RhinoBridge allows for imports into Rhino from Quixel Bridge, using the 'Custom Socket Export' option.
It uses the Quixel 'bridge-c-sharp-plugin' hosted at https://github.com/Quixel/Bridge-C-Sharp-Plugin,
which in itself uses Newtonsoft.Json hosted at https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json.
All software used and the plugIn itself is licensed under the MIT License.
