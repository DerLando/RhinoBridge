## Bridge C# Plugin

The Bridge plugin is an open-source, C#-written integration for Bridge custom exports. The plugin requires .Net 4.0 or later.

This integration gives you a LiveLink between itself and Bridge Custom Exports. The source code is all exposed
and documented for you to use it as you wish (within the Megascans EULA limits, that is).
We provide a set of useful functions for importing json data from Bridge.

This integration was written in a threaded manner to allow the plugin to run in background.
